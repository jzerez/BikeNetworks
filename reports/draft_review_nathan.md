#### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

My understanding is that this team is trying to replicate an experiment where they analyze the food web for redundant connections versus functional connections. Functional connections are neccesary for survival of a species, but redundant connections are not. It is answering the question how does the classification of these relationships as functional vs reduntant impact the extinction rate of a species if they begin removing some of these connections, then comparing this to removing nodes that have the highest degree. . The teams explanation is relatively short but concise and clear, I feel like I can understand what they will be doing after reading the first paragraphs. 


#### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

I understand the removal of nodes with high degrees, but there was some lacking explanation of the second removal method. I would like to know what dominance is and why it matters for classification. It sounds like classification of functional vs redundant nodes is very important to the central question but there isn't much explanation of how this is implemented. I would also like to know more about how survival is measured. 


#### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

The graph is pretty clear, that if they remove central nodes with high degree then more species die. I am unclear about exactly what "Species extinctions" means. It is presented as a percentage, is that the percentage of species in the graph that die, or is it the percentage probability that a certain species will live?

#### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

The current interpretation is very dry, but I imagine with more results for the second half of the experiment will make it more interesting. 

#### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency.  Is it quantitative or qualitative?

They claim that the results for the first experiment match that of the original, but it is fairly qualitative. 

#### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

I am unclear what the extension is, but it might just be that it isn't made very clear where the original experiment ends and what they are adding. 

#### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

Ideally it would be good if they had the second experiment implemented, but beyond that it seems like they have a good working model of extinction which is good. 

#### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

It is written clearly which I liked. It could use a little more beefing up in terms of explaning terms and implementations. 

#### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

Nicely formatted and in the right folder. Looks good to me
