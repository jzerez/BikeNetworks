1) **Question**: This team is trying to use cellular automata in order to replicate scale patterns observed on lizards. They are trying to understand some of the mechanisms behind the patterns observed in the scales of lizards. The team pretty effectively communicate the experiment that they try to replicate.

2)  **Methodology**: I wish that the methodology was a bit more thoroughly explained. In particular, I wish I knew more about the specifics of how the cellular automata from the paper (The aforementioned 'Manukyan model'). The equation or table that relates number of neighbors to probability of changing color would be nice. I think that the team did a good job at pointing out limitations, namely how their hexagonal cells differed from a network of scales from a real lizard. For their second experiment (adding in the brown and white scales), it is really missing a lot of explanation for how the model was made and what rules it follows. There is almost no explanation for how they integrated the white and brown scales into the model.

3)  **Results**: The results for the first part of their experiment are pretty easy to understand, the proposed model shows a PMF that matches the observed data better than a random starting condition. I think that the results for the second part (adding in the brown and white scales) is a bit less clear. The graphics of the scales and how they're colored is helpful in understanding how the models were set up, but it would a lot better to also have graphs that showed the distribution of different colored scales as a function of time. Such a graph would support some of the claims made (ex: the colors change suddenly). Additionally, because there is no presented baseline state observed from nature to compare to, it is hard to claim that the model is doing anything effectively. For the deterministic model, a plot showing the distribution of colored scales versus time could help support claims made. Finally, the graphs produced in the graphical analysis section were really clear and informative.

4) **Interpretation**: I think that the replication of the old experiment offers good interpretation, as they are able to compare to observable behavior from nature to support the behavior of their model. For the brown/white experiments, their interpretation is substantially less solid, as they lack any data to compare their model to. Additionally for the validation section, it is rather unclear to me why they're interested in the size of each subgraph. Looking at the size of each subgraph certainly doesn't help to validate the model like they claim, and especially if they don't have real life data to compare it to.

5) **Replication**: The results seem to be pretty consistent with the results from the paper, at least in terms of showing that similar mechanisms for modeling the scales produces patterns that more closely match nature compared to a random distribution of scales.

6) **Extension**: The extension does have potential, but they need to present some kind of real data to back up any claims that they make.

7) **Progress**: It seems like the team is in a really good spot. IT seems like they have a lot of the code built out, and it will just be a matter of using it to generate content to put in their report.

8) **Presentation**: Apart from some grammatical hiccups towards the end, I think the presentation of the paper is pretty good.

9) **Mechanics**: The mechanisms are all correct.
